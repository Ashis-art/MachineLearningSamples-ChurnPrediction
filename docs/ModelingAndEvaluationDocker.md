# Churn Prediction using AMLWorkbench - Modeling and Evaluation in Docker

## 1. Objectives

The aim of this lab is to generate churn classifiers in a docker container on the local computer. We can use the .dprep file created in the previous labs. However, in this lab, we will reproduce the steps related to data preparation using pandas for flexibility.

## 2. Data Preparation

The csv file can be read using pandas into a dataframe df. The data preparation tasks such as filling in missing values, dropping columns, and removing duplicates can be performed using `fillna()`, `drop()` and `drop_duplicates()` functions from pandas:

```
df = pd.read_csv('data/CATelcoCustomerChurnTrainingSample.csv')
df = df.fillna(0)
df = df.drop_duplicates()
df = df.drop('year', 1)
df = df.drop('month', 1)
```

The rest of the code related to one-hot encoding, splitting the data, and modeling is pretty much the same as in the previous lab. Ensure that the `CATelcoCustomerChurnTrainingSample.csv` is in the data folder.

## 3. Execution â€“ Local Docker Container

Ensure conda_dependencies.yml contains the following dependencies:

```
dependencies:
  - python=3.5.2
  - scikit-learn=0.18.1
```

If you have a Docker engine running locally, in the CLI window, run the below command. Note the change the run configuration from local to docker. PrepareEnvironment must be set to true in aml_config/docker.runconfig before you can submit.

```
az ml experiment submit -c docker CATelcoCustomerChurnModelingDocker.py
```

This command pulls down a base docker image, layers a conda environment on the base image based on the `conda_dependencies.yml` file in the project's _aml_config_ directory, and then starts a Docker container. It then executes your script. You should see some Docker image construction messages in the CLI window. In the end, on successful execution, you will see result as shown below.

The results will be very, very similar to the results that you got when you ran the results locally.
