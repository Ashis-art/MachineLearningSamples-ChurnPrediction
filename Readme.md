# Customer churn prediction using AMLWorkbench

On average, keeping existing customers is five times cheaper than the cost of recruiting new ones. As a result, marketing executives often find themselves trying to estimate the likelihood of customer churn and finding the necessary actions to minimize the churn rate.

The aim of this solution is to demonstrate predictive churn analytics using AMLWorkbench. This solution provides an easy to use template to develop churn predictive data pipelines for retailers. The template can be used with different datasets and different definitions of churn. The aim of the hands on labs is to:

1. Understand how AMLWorkbenchâ€™s Data Preparation tools (based on Pendleton) can be used to clean and ingest customer relationship data      for churn analytics.
2. Perform feature transformation to handle noisy heterogeneous data.
3. Integrate third-party libraries (such as scikit-learn and azureml) to develop bayesian and tree based classifiers for predicting          churn.
4. Perform operationalization.
